Well, we got the two routers set up and connected. We managed to get them talking nicely, sending data to and from the tx2 and kyle's laptop through the routers.
We intend to connect the python code we have on kyles laptop, I.E. the control interface to the user input node on ros using the rosbridge_server which uses websockets for fast communications.
