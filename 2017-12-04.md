- downloaded neovim and created an init.vim for it (~/.config.nvim/init.vim) if
anyone is interested. Basically just an upgraded vim with plugins.
- fixed up the logbook.sh file so it pulls before commiting and  pushing.
- added the --author arg to the logbook commit so the author is overrided. stll not
sure if this solved the problem....
