# SPEAR LOGBOOK 

This folder is a logbook for the SPEAR software team. Each log file describes what was changed/worked on for that specific date. Each logbook is created by running the 'lb' command in the terminal. This creates a markdown file for that specfic date and places it in the logbook folder.

## Setup
```bash
echo "source /path/to/logbook.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage:
1. In terminal type
```bash
lb
```
2. A new log file will open in vim. Type your log entry into the file.
3. Save and exit (TYPE ":wq")
