# SPEAR LOGBOOK 

This folder is a logbook for the SPEAR software team. Each log file describes what was changed/worked on for that specific date. Each logbook is created by running the 'lb' command in the terminal. The bash command creates a markdown file for that specfic date and places it in the logbook folder.

## TO RUN:
In terminal run: 'lb'
Type your log into the file opened in vim
Save and exit
