# Kyle and Jacob, another failed arduino attempt
So, we successfully connnected an arduino to a board, however it was not one of the M0, it was my own mega.
And, the board wasn't the jetson, it was the raspberry pi. However this does confirm our hypothesis, 
that arduino's can be connected and communicated with programmatically with [ACM](https://rfc1149.net/blog/2013/03/05/what-is-the-difference-between-devttyusbx-and-devttyacmx/) serial connections.
For some reason, probably due to lack of competency, we still can't get the jetson to talk directly with the arduino. If anyone
has experience with arduino's or connecting to the arduino please help.

At this point, we are strongly leaning towards abandoning usb serial connections directly from the jetson to the arduino,
and instead, either having it communicate through the pi, or through the jetson's own pins to the arduino's pins.
