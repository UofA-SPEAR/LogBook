# Nark Griffith and Jordan Lame created this :)

- README.md in logbook desktop folder

- Assigned static ip addresses to the RPI (192.168.0.62) and TX2 (192.168.0.61) and 
- created 'Static IPs' doc in the Documentation folder on the drive. 
- NVIDIA and RPi can now communicate 

- Killed wifi (ran rkill block wifi) because wifi connection was interferring with static ip assignment in local network
- If you need internet connection - use the ethernet from the main computer\

- NEXT: Need to backup ubuntu image before creating the ROS structure. Jordan is going to buy a usb, and backup the image for a clean recovery.
